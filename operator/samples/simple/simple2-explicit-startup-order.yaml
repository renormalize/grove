# This PodGangSet definition explicitly sets the startup order of the cliques.
# Startup order is observed amongst the PodCliques that are part of a PodGang that is created for a PodGangSet.
# In the example below, the following startup order is expected for every PodGang that is created for this PodGangSet.
# 1. pca (this is the first clique to start)
# 2. pcb, pcc (these two cliques will start in parallel after pca)
# 3. pcd (this clique will start after pcb and pcc)
#
# To verify the startup order, you can inspect the following:
# - For each Pod belonging to a PodClique, check the `LastTransitionTime` of the Pod's `Ready` condition.
#   The `LastTransitionTime` should reflect the order in which the Pods became ready.
# - In addition, you can check the logs of the last `InitContainer` of each Pod to get the details of dependency handling.
