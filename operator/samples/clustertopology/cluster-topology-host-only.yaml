# ClusterTopology with minimal single-level hierarchy
#
# This example demonstrates the simplest possible ClusterTopology configuration
# with only the host level. This is useful for:
# - Simple clusters without complex network topology
# - Testing topology-aware scheduling with minimal setup
# - Constraining pod placement to individual hosts
#
# Note: ClusterTopology is a cluster-scoped resource (non-namespaced)
