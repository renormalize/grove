## Summary

Grove's scheduler API is currently integrated with the KAI scheduler as the only advanced AI scheduler that supports hierarchical gang-scheduling and topology-aware scheduling. While any custom scheduler can integrate with Grove's PodGang scheduling API, the onus remains on the external scheduler to do the heavy lifting of the integration effort. It also becomes difficult to add any scheduler specific logic from the operator. This proposal introduces a Scheduler Backend Framework that standardizes and simplifies the process of adding new scheduler support directly into Grove, making it easier to handle scheduler specific logic in its own backend.

## Motivation
Grove's unified API for AI workloads (training, inference, agents, etc.) allows the Grove operator to realize a workload's scheduling constraints through the PodGang API. Since the PodGang API is specific to Grove, it needs to be translated to constraints that are specific to the backend scheduler. While it is possible for each scheduler to support Grove independently by implementing its own translation layer, it will likely introduce maintenance issues over time as Grove keeps evolving its scheduler constraint generation capabilities.

Introducing a Scheduler Backend Framework addresses these challenges by providing:

* **Standardized Integration**: A well-defined interface and abstraction layer that makes adding a new scheduler backend easier and more standardized.
* **Reduced Invasiveness**: Minimal modifications to existing scheduler implementations, allowing schedulers to integrate with Grove through a plugin-like architecture.
* **Improved Scheduling Flow**: A more efficient and streamlined scheduling workflow that clearly separates concerns between Grove's workload management and scheduler-specific placement decisions.
* **Future-Proof Architecture**: A foundation that can adapt to emerging scheduling requirements and new scheduler implementations in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

In summary, refining Grove and introducing a Scheduler Backend Framework is both an urgent and inevitable improvement that will ensure Grove's long-term viability and extensibility in the evolving Kubernetes scheduling landscape.

### Goals

* **Define Scheduler Backend Interface**: Introduce a well-defined Go interface that abstracts scheduler-specific operations, enabling Grove to work with multiple scheduler backends through a standardized contract.
* **Refine PodGang Lifecycle Management**: Optimize the PodGang creation and update workflow to integrate with the Scheduler Backend Framework, allowing scheduler backends to customize pod specifications during reconciliation.
* **Enable Custom Resource Management**: Provide interfaces that allow Scheduler Backends to create, update, and delete their own custom resources in response to PodGang lifecycle events (create, update, delete, status changes).
* **Simplify Configuration and Selection**: Allow admins to configure scheduler backends during Grove installation via OperatorConfiguration. By default, the configured default backend is used; otherwise the workload can specify a scheduler backend (e.g. via `schedulerName` in the pod spec).
* **Multiple Backends and Dynamic Selection**: Provide clear mechanisms for backend registration and initialization, built-in support for multiple scheduler backends (e.g. Kubernetes default-scheduler and kai-scheduler), and a clear path for third-party schedulers. At runtime, Grove selects the backend per workload from OperatorConfiguration and the workload's `schedulerName` in the pod spec.

### Non-Goals

* **Cluster topology and multi-cluster scheduling**: This GREP does not define or support cluster topology (e.g. multi-cluster topology) in the scheduler backend interface. Addressing those concerns may require additional extension points or interface methods in a future proposal and is out of scope here.
* **PodReferences definition and semantics**: Redefining or formally specifying the existing `PodReferences` field (e.g. structure, ownership, and how it is populated) is out of scope. This proposal relies on current behavior and may be updated in a follow-up if that is clarified elsewhere.

## Proposal

The Scheduler Backend Framework introduces a plugin-like architecture that decouples Grove's workload management from scheduler-specific implementations. The framework consists of four main components:

1. **Interface**: A Go interface defining the contract between Grove and scheduler backends.
2. **Registry**: Mechanism for scheduler backends to register themselves during initialization.
3. **Lifecycle Hooks**: Well-defined points in the PodGang lifecycle where backend schedulers can inject custom logic.
4. **Operator Configuration**: OperatorConfiguration allows enabling multiple scheduler backends simultaneously. 

The framework follows an architecture where:
- The operator configuration determines which schedulers are active at runtime and which scheduler is marked as default. Grove supports multiple active schedulers.
- Scheduler backend(s) implement the interface to provide scheduler-specific behavior.
- Grove manages the high-level workflow and `PodGang` lifecycle.

### User Stories

#### Story 1: Third-Party Scheduler Integration

As a third-party scheduler developer, I want to integrate my custom gang scheduler with Grove without modifying Grove's core codebase. The Scheduler Backend Framework should provide clear interfaces and documentation that allow me to implement a backend plugin for my scheduler, register it with Grove, and have Grove automatically use my scheduler for workload placement decisions.

#### Story 2: Configure Grove with one or more Schedulers

As a platform engineer managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, I want to deploy Grove across clusters that use different schedulers. A well defined API should be provided to configure Grove to start with one or more schedulers. Currently Grove is configured via `OperatorConfiguration`. This API type should be extended to provide support to enable one or more schedulers and mark one of these schedulers as a *default* scheduler.

### Limitations/Risks & Mitigations

#### Backend API Stability

**Risk**: Changes to the backend interface in future Grove versions could break existing backend implementations.

**Mitigation**:
- Follow semantic versioning for backend interfaces
- Maintain backward compatibility within major versions
- Provide deprecation notices and migration guides for interface changes
- Consider versioned interfaces if breaking changes are necessary

#### Scheduler Capability Mismatch

**Limitation**:
Different schedulers have varying capabilities, which may not align with the uniform capability set exposed through the PodGang API.

**Mitigation**:
- **For Missing Capabilities**: The framework provides a clear contract so that each scheduler backend can decide how to handle requested features it does not support:
  - **Fail submit**: The scheduler backend can reject PodCliqueSet when the missing capability is required for correctness or safety.
  - **Pass through**: The backend allows the request and the workload proceeds; the backend should ensure PodCliqueSet status is updated with conditions indicating which features are not supported (e.g. "GangScheduling requested but not supported by this backend—workload scheduled without gang guarantees"). This gives users explicit feedback while allowing best-effort scheduling.

  The choice between fail vs pass-through is entirely up to each backend implementation, so that different schedulers can adopt the policy that fits their semantics
  
  > NOTE: Validation should respect API semantics. For example: If TAS `required` constraint(s) are defined for a PCS and the scheduler chosen does not yet support TAS then it should return an error.
- **For Additional Capabilities**: Document and track scheduler-specific capabilities during the integration process. If a scheduler provides valuable additional features that require configuration, evaluate adding new fields to the PodCliqueSet and PodGang APIs. These API extensions can be implemented incrementally in phases as new schedulers are integrated.

## Design Details

### Architecture Overview

The Scheduler Backend Framework introduces a clean separation between Grove's control plane logic and scheduler-specific implementations. The architecture is organized into three distinct layers:

<img src="assets/schedulerbackend-framework.excalidraw.png" alt="scheduler-backend-framework-architecture" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Grove Configuration Layer
`OperatorConfiguration` is extended to provide support to define scheduler profiles that should be enabled when starting Grove operator.  Additionally provides a capability to mark one of the scheduler backend as a default.

#### Grove Controller Layer

> NOTE: Only controllers that are relevant in context of this GREP are shown. For each such controller only scheduler specific functional touchpoints are briefly mentioned.

- **PodCliqueSet Controller**: Manages (Creates/Updates/Deletes) `PodGang` resources.
- **PodClique Controller**: Manages Pods. As part of building the `Pod` resource, it invokes `SchedulerBackend.PreparePod()` to inject scheduler specific configuration into the PodSpec.
- **Backend Controller**: Watches `PodGang` resources, calls `SchedulerBackend.SyncPodGang()` to creates scheduler specific CRs if needed.
- **PodCliqueSet Validation Webhook**: Admits create/update of `PodCliqueSet` by calling the relevant scheduler backend's `ValidatePodCliqueSet()` to run scheduler specific validations if defined. In addition it validates `schedulerName` if configured in `PodSpec` across `PodClique` template specifications.

#### Scheduler Backend Layer
This is where you have implementations of the `SchedulerBackend` interface. 

### Key Control Flow

The framework orchestrates workload scheduling through a coordinated flow between layers:
1. **Backend Initialization**: Operator startup initializes the configured scheduler backend via Backend Manager.
2. **PCS Admission**: On PodCliqueSet create or update, the validation webhook resolves the backend and calls `ValidatePodCliqueSet()`; the request is admitted or rejected accordingly.
3. **PodGang Creation**: PodCliqueSet Controller creates PodGang resources with `Initialized=False` condition, triggering Backend Controller to create scheduler-specific resources via `SyncPodGang()`.
4. **Pod Configuration**: PodClique Controller creates Pods with scheduling gates, calling `PreparePod()` to inject scheduler-specific settings.
5. **Scheduling Activation**: Once all pods exist and PodReferences are populated, the `Initialized` condition is set to `True`, gates are removed, and scheduling begins.

For detailed lifecycle flow, see [PodGang Lifecycle Changes](#podgang-lifecycle-changes).

### Scheduler Backend Interface

The core of the framework is the `Backend` interface, which defines all operations that a scheduler backend must implement. The interface is intentionally simple and focused:

```go
package scheduler

// SchedulerBackend defines the interface that different scheduler backends must implement.
//
// Architecture: Backend validates PodCliqueSet at admission, converts
// PodGang to scheduler-specific CR (PodGroup/Workload/etc), and prepares Pods with scheduler-specific configurations.
type Backend interface {
	// Name is a unique name of the scheduler backend.
	// Used for logging and identification purposes.
	Name() string

	// Init provides a hook to initialize/setup one-time scheduler resources,
	// called at the startup of Grove operator.
	// Backends can perform tasks such as:
	// - Creating global custom resources required by the scheduler
	// - Validating scheduler availability and configuration
	// - Setting up any initial state
	Init() error

	// SyncPodGang synchronizes (creates/updates) scheduler-specific resources for a PodGang
	// reacting to a creation or update of a PodGang resource.
	// This is called by the Backend Controller when PodGang spec changes.
	// Backends should:
	// - Create scheduler-specific custom resources (e.g., PodGroup, Workload)
	// - Update existing resources if the PodGang spec changed
	// - Use owner references to enable automatic cleanup
	SyncPodGang(ctx context.Context, podGang *groveschedulerv1alpha1.PodGang) error

	// OnPodGangDelete cleans up scheduler-specific resources for the given PodGang.
	// This is called when a PodGang is deleted.
	// Note: If using owner references, cleanup is automatic and this can be a no-op.
	OnPodGangDelete(ctx context.Context, podGang *groveschedulerv1alpha1.PodGang) error

	// PreparePod adds scheduler-backend-specific configuration to the given Pod object
	// prior to its creation. This includes setting schedulerName,
	// annotations, etc.
	// This is called during Pod creation in the PodClique controller.
	PreparePod(pod *corev1.Pod)

	// ValidatePodCliqueSet provides an ability to the scheduler backends to run additional
	// validations on the PodCliqueSet resource. For example - if a scheduler does not yet support
	// topology aware placements and if the PodCliqueSet has defined required topology pack constraints
	// then it can choose to reject the PodCliqueSet by returning an error. 
	ValidatePodCliqueSet(ctx context.Context, pcs *groveschedulerv1alpha1.PodCliqueSet) error
}
```

### Backend Manager

The manager initializes the **enabled** scheduler backends (as defined in OperatorConfiguration: the default-scheduler backend is always enabled; other backends are enabled via profiles). The manager provides access by backend name and exposes whichever backend OperatorConfiguration designates as the default:

```go

// Initialize creates and registers backend instances: default-scheduler is always registered;
// backends named in config.Profiles are also registered (profiles can include or omit default-scheduler).
// Called once during operator startup before controllers start.
func Initialize(client client.Client, scheme *runtime.Scheme, eventRecorder record.EventRecorder, config SchedulerConfiguration) error

// Get returns the backend for the given name. default-scheduler is always available; other backends return nil if not enabled via a profile.
func Get(name string) SchedulerBackend

// GetDefault returns the backend designated as default in OperatorConfiguration (scheduler.defaultProfileName).
func GetDefault() SchedulerBackend

```


### OperatorConfiguration Extension

**API:**

```go
// OperatorConfiguration defines the configuration for the Grove operator.
type OperatorConfiguration struct {
	// ... existing fields (Controllers, LogLevel, etc.) ...

	// Scheduler configures which scheduler backends are active and their per-backend options.
	Scheduler SchedulerConfiguration `json:"scheduler,omitempty"`

	// TopologyAwareScheduling configures TAS (existing field)
	TopologyAwareScheduling TopologyAwareSchedulingConfiguration `json:"topologyAwareScheduling"`

	// ... other existing fields ...
}

// SchedulerConfiguration configures scheduler profiles and which is the default.
type SchedulerConfiguration struct {
	// Profiles is the list of scheduler profiles. Each profile has a backend name and optional config.
	// The default-scheduler backend is always enabled and active even if not listed here. Listing "default-scheduler" in profiles
	// only adds a profile (e.g. with config like GangScheduling: false). Use defaultProfileName to designate the default backend.
	// Valid backend names: "default-scheduler", "kai-scheduler". If defaultProfileName is unset, defaulting sets it to "default-scheduler".
	// +optional
	Profiles []SchedulerProfile `json:"profiles,omitempty"`
	// DefaultProfileName is the name of the default scheduler profile.
	// +optional
	DefaultProfileName string `json:"defaultProfileName,omitempty"`
}

// SchedulerName is the name for a supported scheduler backend.
type SchedulerName string

// Constants for names of all supported scheduler backends.
const (
  // SchedulerNameKAI is the name of KAI scheduler.
  SchedulerNameKAI SchedulerName = "kai-scheduler"
  // SchedulerNameKube is the name for Kubernetes' default scheduler.
  // The value "default-scheduler" matches the actual schedulerName used in Kubernetes pods.
  // Note: Throughout this document, "default-scheduler" and "default-scheduler" refer to the same scheduler.
  SchedulerNameKube SchedulerName = "default-scheduler"
  // <add a new constant for any new scheduler backend here>
)

// SupportedSchedulerNames is a list of all scheduler backends that are supported in Grove.
var SupportedSchedulerNames = []SchedulerName {
  SchedulerNameKAI,
  SchedulerNameKube,
  // <add any other supported backend scheduler constant here>
 }

// SchedulerProfile defines a scheduler backend profile with optional backend-specific config.
type SchedulerProfile struct {
	// Name is the scheduler backend name. Valid values: "default-scheduler", "kai-scheduler".
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=kai-scheduler;default-scheduler
	Name SchedulerName `json:"name"`

	// Config holds backend-specific options. The operator unmarshals it into the config type for this backend (see backend config types below).
	// +optional
	Config *runtime.RawExtension `json:"config,omitempty"`
}
```

The `OperatorConfiguration` provides a way to enable and configure one or more scheduler backends. `SchedulerProfile` allows you to configure the following:

- **Name:** This is the name of the scheduler backend. This must be one of the supported schedulers.
- **Config:** Optional scheduler-specific configuration as `runtime.RawExtension`. It is the responsibility of the scheduler backend implementation to interpret and possibly deserialize it to type.

`SchedulerConfiguration.defaultProfileName` designates which profile is the default. When no scheduler name is set in any `PodSpec` across all `PodCliqueTemplateSpec`, the default scheduler indicated by `defaultProfileName` will be used.

**Backend Enabling Behavior:**

The default-scheduler backend has special behavior compared to other scheduler backends:

1. **Always Implicitly Available**: The default-scheduler backend is always initialized and available via the Backend Manager, even when `scheduler.profiles` is empty or omitted. This ensures backward compatibility and provides a fallback scheduler.

2. **Explicit Configuration Optional**: You only need to add default-scheduler to `profiles` if you want to:
   - Configure it with specific options (e.g., `gangScheduling: true`)
   - Set it as the default via `defaultProfileName` (defaulting sets default-scheduler as default when `defaultProfileName` is unset)

3. **Other Schedulers Require Explicit Enablement**: All non default-scheduler backends (kai-scheduler, third-party schedulers) must be explicitly listed in `profiles` to be enabled. If a workload references a scheduler that is not in the profiles list, the validating webhook will reject the PodCliqueSet.

4. **Default Selection Logic**:
   - If `profiles` is empty → defaulting adds default-scheduler and sets `defaultProfileName: "default-scheduler"`
   - `defaultProfileName` must be one of the configured profile names; validation rejects invalid or missing default profile name

If no `SchedulerProfile` has been set, then Grove operator behaves as if you specified:
```yaml
scheduler:
  defaultProfileName: default-scheduler
  profiles:
    - name: default-scheduler
```

> NOTE: If you as a workload operator wish to use a specific scheduler, please ensure that it has been enabled and properly configured as part of `OperatorConfiguration`. If PodCliqueSet uses a scheduler which has not been enabled, then the validating webhook will reject any creation request for this PodCliqueSet.

**Example Typed Scheduler Backend Config**

```go
// KubeSchedulerConfig holds the configuration for the default scheduler.
type KubeSchedulerConfig struct {
  // GangScheduling indicates if Gang scheduling capability is enabled. The default scheduler
  // can be used with or without the gang scheduling capability.
  // See https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/0ba3b069c5071d2b8def5d63dfa4592754c18bd4/scheduling/v1alpha1/types.go#L185-L203  
  GangScheduling bool `json:"gangScheduling,omitempty"`
}
```

**Example YAML (OperatorConfiguration):**

```yaml
# --- Omit scheduler profiles completely ---
# Same as defaultProfileName: default-scheduler, profiles: [{ name: "default-scheduler" }]
```

```yaml
# --- Single scheduler profile, no specific configuration ---
scheduler:
  defaultProfileName: default-scheduler
  profiles:
    - name: default-scheduler
      # In this configuration Gang Scheduling will not be enabled
```

```yaml
# --- Single scheduler profile with configuration ---
scheduler:
  defaultProfileName: default-scheduler
  profiles:
    - name: default-scheduler
      config:
        gangScheduling: true
```

```yaml
# --- Multiple scheduler profiles; default is default-scheduler ---
scheduler:
  defaultProfileName: default-scheduler
  profiles:
    - name: default-scheduler
      config:
        gangScheduling: true
    - name: kai-scheduler # no scheduler-specific configuration is defined
```

```yaml
# --- Only kai-scheduler profile; default-scheduler is still implicitly available but kai-scheduler is the default --- 
scheduler:
  defaultProfileName: kai-scheduler
  profiles:
    - name: kai-scheduler
      config: {}
```



### PodGang Lifecycle Changes

The PodGang creation flow has been changed to support default-scheduler's `Workload` API. 

> NOTE: If you are not directly consuming `PodGang` then you are not impacted.

#### Current PodGang Creation Flow
1. Pods are created first
2. Wait for all pods to have back-references to PodGang
3. Create PodGang with complete PodReferences

#### Revised PodGang Creation Flow
To understand the new `PodGang` creation flow, we first introduce the enhancements made to the `PodGangStatus`.

##### PodGang API enhancements
A new `metav1.Condition` has been introduced for `PodGang`.

```go
const (
	// PodGangConditionTypeInitialized indicates that the PodGang has been populated
	// with pod references and pods can lift scheduling gates.
	PodGangConditionTypeInitialized PodGangConditionType = "Initialized"
)
```

| Status  | Reason        | Description                                     |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `True`  | `Ready`       | PodGang is fully initialized (see below).       |
| `False` | `PodsPending` | Not all constituent pods have been created yet. |

A `PodGang` is considered as `Initialized` when:

* All constituent Pods are created.
* Pods back-reference to their PodGang via a grove.io/podgang label.
* PodGang.Spec.PodGroups have PodReferences fully populated.

> NOTE: Field PodReferences in PodGang.Spec.PodGroups is subject to change. If it does then this GREP will need to be updated accordingly.

##### Creation Flow
1. **Create PodGang early** with PodGroups having empty PodReferences. At this stage the `Initialized` condition has `Status` set to `False`.
2. **Backend creates scheduler-specific CRs**: The Backend Controller reconciles the new PodGang and calls `SyncPodGang()` on the resolved backend. The backend creates or updates its scheduler-specific resources (e.g. PodGroup for kai-scheduler, Workload for default-scheduler when supported). These CRs must exist before pods are allowed to be scheduled so the scheduler can enforce gang/topology semantics.
3. **Create Pods** (with scheduling gates to block scheduling). Pod creation may call `PreparePod()` to inject scheduler-specific settings (e.g. schedulerName, annotations,`WorkloadRef` etc.).
4. **Update PodGang** with PodReferences once all pods are created, and set `Initialized=True`.
5. **Scheduling gates are removed** to allow pods to be scheduled. The scheduler uses the backend-created CRs (PodGroup/Workload) when placing pods.


### Test Plan

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests will cover the main framework areas: backend interface and registry behavior, each backend implementation’s contract (e.g. `PreparePod`, `ValidatePodCliqueSet`), controller integration with backend hooks (PodGang lifecycle, pod creation and scheduling gates), and OperatorConfiguration parsing and defaulting. 


#### E2E Tests

Today, E2E tests assume a single scheduler backend (e.g. KAI) and there is no way to configure which backend the test environment uses. The following changes are needed to align with this design and to run all E2E tests with the kai-scheduler:

1. **Make the scheduler backend configurable in E2E**
   The E2E harness (cluster bring-up, operator deployment) must supply [OperatorConfiguration](#operatorconfiguration-extension) so that the operator runs with the desired backend(s).

2. **Configure E2E to use kai-scheduler so all tests pass**
   To run the existing E2E suite (which assumes KAI behavior) and have all tests pass, the test environment must deploy the operator with OperatorConfiguration that enables kai-scheduler and sets it as the default.

3. **Scope of E2E**
   Once the backend is configurable, existing E2E tests should pass with the configured backend (kai-scheduler for the current suite). The test plan should also cover running against other supported backends where feasible.


### Graduation Criteria

The Scheduler Backend Framework will follow a staged rollout approach:

#### Alpha
- Core backend interface defined and implemented
- Backend registry functional
- Basic operator configuration support
- KAI backend and kube backend both supported and configurable via OperatorConfiguration

#### Beta 
- Backend interface stabilized (no breaking changes expected)
- Documentation for third-party backend development
- Kube backend support for advanced community features (e.g. Workload API for gang scheduling) as they become available in Kubernetes

#### GA
- Backend interface is stable and versioned
- Multiple production deployments using the framework
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- All tests passing consistently
- Support for at least 2-3 different scheduler backends
