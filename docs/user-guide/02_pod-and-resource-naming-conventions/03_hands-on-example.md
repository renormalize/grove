# Hands-On Example: Multi-Node Disaggregated Inference

This guide walks through deploying a realistic example that demonstrates both naming patterns and the requirement for unique PodClique names. Make sure you've read the [Naming Conventions](./02_naming-conventions.md) guide first to understand the patterns we'll see in action.

## The Example System

Let's deploy an example with the structure of a multi-node disaggregated inference system:
- A standalone frontend component
- A prefill PodCliqueScalingGroup with leader and workers
- A decode PodCliqueScalingGroup with leader and workers

```yaml
apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodCliqueSet
metadata:
  name: mn-disagg
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    cliques:
    # Standalone PodClique
    - name: frontend
      spec:
        replicas: 2
        podSpec:
          tolerations:
          - key: fake-node
            operator: Equal
            value: "true"
            effect: NoSchedule
          containers:
          - name: frontend
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh"]
            args: ["-c", "echo 'Frontend' && hostname && sleep infinity"]
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: "10m"
                memory: "32Mi"
    # Prefill PodCliqueScalingGroup PodCliques
    - name: pleader
      spec:
        roleName: pleader
        replicas: 1
        podSpec:
          tolerations:
          - key: fake-node
            operator: Equal
            value: "true"
            effect: NoSchedule
          containers:
          - name: pleader
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh"]
            args: ["-c", "echo 'Prefill Leader' && hostname && sleep infinity"]
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: "10m"
                memory: "32Mi"
    - name: pworker
      spec:
        roleName: pworker
        replicas: 3
        podSpec:
          tolerations:
          - key: fake-node
            operator: Equal
            value: "true"
            effect: NoSchedule
          containers:
          - name: pworker
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh"]
            args: ["-c", "echo 'Prefill Worker' && hostname && sleep infinity"]
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: "10m"
                memory: "32Mi"
    # Decode PodCliqueScalingGroup PodCliques
    - name: dleader
      spec:
        roleName: dleader
        replicas: 1
        podSpec:
          tolerations:
          - key: fake-node
            operator: Equal
            value: "true"
            effect: NoSchedule
          containers:
          - name: dleader
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh"]
            args: ["-c", "echo 'Decode Leader' && hostname && sleep infinity"]
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: "10m"
                memory: "32Mi"
    - name: dworker
      spec:
        roleName: dworker
        replicas: 2
        podSpec:
          tolerations:
          - key: fake-node
            operator: Equal
            value: "true"
            effect: NoSchedule
          containers:
          - name: dworker
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh"]
            args: ["-c", "echo 'Decode Worker' && hostname && sleep infinity"]
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: "10m"
                memory: "32Mi"
    podCliqueScalingGroups:
    - name: prefill
      cliqueNames: [pleader, pworker]
      replicas: 2
    - name: decode
      cliqueNames: [dleader, dworker]
      replicas: 1
```

## Why Unique PodClique Names Matter

Notice in the YAML above:
- Prefill PCSG uses `pleader` and `pworker` (not just `leader` and `worker`)
- Decode PCSG uses `dleader` and `dworker` (not just `leader` and `worker`)

**Why?**

PodClique names **must be unique within a PodCliqueSet**. Reusing generic names like `leader` and `worker` across multiple PodCliqueScalingGroups is therefore **not allowed**.

More importantly, this reflects **Grove's core philosophy**.

In Grove, a `PodCliqueSet` is how you describe the **components of your system**. Each `PodClique` represents one component with a clearly defined, globally meaningful role. PodClique names are meant to be stable identifiers for those roles (e.g. prefill leader, decode worker), not local labels that change depending on how components are grouped or scaled.

When multiple components need to be co-scheduled, scaled together, and function as a single logical unit (e.g. a *super-pod* for prefill), they are placed into a `PodCliqueScalingGroup`. The scaling group defines *how components run together*, but it does not redefine or merge their identities.

That said, Grove also aims to keep names concise. Rather than naming a `PodClique` `prefill-leader`, we use short prefixes such as `p` (prefill) and `d` (decode) to preserve uniqueness while keeping names short and readable. The `PodCliqueScalingGroup` name already conveys which logical unit a PodClique belongs to, allowing the PodClique name itself to remain compact without losing clarity.

This is why `pleader`/`pworker` and `dleader`/`dworker` are the intended and recommended pattern.


## Deploy and Observe

In this example, we will deploy the file: [multinode-disaggregated-with-frontend.yaml](../../../operator/samples/user-guide/02_pod-and-resource-naming-conventions/multinode-disaggregated-with-frontend.yaml)

```bash
# NOTE: Run the following commands from the `/path/to/grove/operator` directory,
# where `/path/to/grove` is the root of your cloned Grove repository.
kubectl apply -f samples/user-guide/02_pod-and-resource-naming-conventions/multinode-disaggregated-with-frontend.yaml

# Get all pods - observe the self-documenting names
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=mn-disagg -o wide
```

You should see output like:
```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mn-disagg-0-decode-0-dleader-abc12     1/1     Running   0          45s

mn-disagg-0-prefill-1-pworker-klm56    1/1     Running   0          45s
```

## Parsing the Naming Hierarchy

Looking at this output, you can immediately understand the system structure:

**1. Standalone PodClique (frontend):**
```
mn-disagg-0-frontend-*
```
- Simpler naming: `<pcs>-<pcs-idx>-<pclq>-<suffix>`
- 2 frontend pods serving requests

**2. PodCliqueScalingGroup (prefill) - 2 replicas:**
```
mn-disagg-0-prefill-0-*
mn-disagg-0-prefill-1-*
```
- Deeper hierarchy: `<pcs>-<pcs-idx>-<pcsg>-<pcsg-idx>-<pclq>-<suffix>`
- Each replica has 1 `pleader` + 3 `pworker` pods
- Two independent prefill clusters

**3. PodCliqueScalingGroup (decode) - 1 replica:**
```
mn-disagg-0-decode-0-*
```
- Same deep hierarchy as prefill
- Has 1 `dleader` + 2 `dworker` pods
- One decode cluster

**4. Clear role identification through naming:**
- `frontend` = frontend component
- `pleader` = prefill leader
- `pworker` = prefill worker
- `dleader` = decode leader
- `dworker` = decode worker

## Examining Resources

Let's look at the underlying Grove resources:

```bash
# List PodCliques
kubectl get pclq
```

Output:
```
NAME                           AGE
mn-disagg-0-decode-0-dleader   2m
mn-disagg-0-decode-0-dworker   2m
mn-disagg-0-frontend           2m
mn-disagg-0-prefill-0-pleader  2m
mn-disagg-0-prefill-0-pworker  2m
mn-disagg-0-prefill-1-pleader  2m
mn-disagg-0-prefill-1-pworker  2m
```

**Observations:**
- Standalone PodClique: `mn-disagg-0-frontend`
- Prefill PCSG PodCliques: Names include `prefill-0` or `prefill-1` to show which replica
- Decode PCSG PodCliques: Names include `decode-0`
- All names are unique and under 63 characters

```bash
# List PodCliqueScalingGroups
kubectl get pcsg
```

Output:
```
NAME                    AGE
mn-disagg-0-decode      2m
mn-disagg-0-prefill     2m
```

The PCSG names clearly identify the two scaling groups.

## Name Length Analysis

Pod names have a 63-character limit (DNS label constraint). Let's verify our longest pod name fits:

- Longest pod name: `mn-disagg-0-prefill-1-pworker-klm56`
  - Characters: 35 (well under 63) ✅

With 28 characters of headroom, this naming scheme can scale to millions of replicas on both PCS and PCSG dimensions without hitting the limit.

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete pcs mn-disagg
```
