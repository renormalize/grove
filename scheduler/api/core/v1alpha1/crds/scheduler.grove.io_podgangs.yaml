                  finds that the reservation done previously was network optimised and there are no better alternatives available, then it
                  will reuse the reservation. If there are better alternatives available, then the scheduler will ignore this suggestion.

                  best possible placement of the pods in the PodGang, then the score will be 1.0. Higher the score, better the placement.
